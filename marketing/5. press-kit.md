## 📝 Press Release

### 🚀 **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**BlinkBudget Launches Revolutionary 3-Click Expense Tracking App**

**NEW YORK, NY – January 2026** – BlinkBudget today announced the launch of its revolutionary expense tracking application that transforms budgeting from a time-consuming chore into a seamless habit. The app's breakthrough "3-Click Guarantee" allows users to log any expense in just three clicks, making it the fastest expense tracking solution on the market.

Traditional expense tracking apps require 8-12 clicks per entry, costing users valuable time and creating friction that discourages consistent budgeting. BlinkBudget's innovative approach reduces this to just three clicks: select category, enter amount, and save.

"We looked at the market and saw that expense tracking had become unnecessarily complicated," said Krasen Ivanov, founder of BlinkBudget. "Our mission was simple: make expense tracking so fast and effortless that users would actually stick with it. The result is BlinkBudget – where tracking expenses takes less time than making the purchase itself."

**Key Features Include:**

- **3-Click Entry**: Industry's fastest expense logging
- **Beautiful Analytics**: AI-powered spending insights and visualizations
- **Offline-First PWA**: Works anywhere, installs like a native app
- **Privacy-First**: Local data storage with optional cloud sync
- **Mobile Optimized**: Perfect for one-handed, on-the-go use

**Performance Highlights:**

- **3x Faster**: Than leading competitors like Mint and YNAB
- **Sub-2 Second Load**: Instant app startup and responsiveness
- **Works Offline**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamless experience on any device

**Launch Special:**
To celebrate the launch, BlinkBudget is offering free premium features to the first 10,000 users, along with a lifetime 50% discount on future premium features.

**Availability:**
BlinkBudget is available immediately at [blinkbudget.app](https://blinkbudget.app) and works on any modern browser. Native iOS and Android apps are planned for Q2 2026.

**About BlinkBudget:**
