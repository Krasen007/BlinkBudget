# How-to: Quick Amount Presets

Quick Amount Presets help you enter transactions faster by showing your most frequently used amounts right on the transaction form.

## 1. What Are Quick Amount Presets?

Quick Amount Presets are your most commonly used expense amounts, automatically calculated from your transaction history.

### Benefits

- Faster Entry: Tap a button instead of typing numbers
- Personalized: Shows your most-used amounts
- Smart Learning: Automatically updates as you add more transactions
- Visual Feedback: See how many times you have used each amount

## 2. How Presets Are Calculated

BlinkBudget analyzes your transaction history:

1. Only expense transactions are counted
2. The system tracks how many times you enter each amount
3. Your top 4 most frequent amounts become your presets
4. Presets update automatically when you add new transactions

### Requirements

- Minimum of 4 different expense amounts in your history
- More transactions = more accurate presets

## 3. Using Quick Amount Presets

### On Mobile

1. Open the Add Transaction screen
2. Look for the preset buttons above the amount input
3. Tap any preset button to instantly fill that amount
4. Complete the transaction as normal

### On Desktop

1. Click the + Add button
2. Locate the preset buttons near the amount field
3. Click a preset to auto-fill the amount
4. Finish entering your transaction details

## 4. Understanding Preset Buttons

Each preset button shows:

- The amount (e.g., 10, 20, 50)
- Usage count - how many times you have used this amount
- Percentage - what portion of your transactions use this amount

The buttons are ordered by frequency - your most-used amount appears first.

## 5. Tips for Best Results

### Add More Transactions

The more transactions you have, the smarter your presets become.

### Use Consistent Amounts

If you typically spend around specific amounts, try to use similar amounts consistently.

### Check Preset Accuracy

If your presets do not seem right, add a few more transactions and they will automatically update.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Presets Show Wrong Amounts

- This is normal with few transactions
- Add more transactions to improve accuracy

### No Presets Showing

- You need at least 4 different expense amounts
- All transactions must be expenses (not income)

### Presets Not Updating

- Presets update after each new transaction
- Try adding a few more transactions
