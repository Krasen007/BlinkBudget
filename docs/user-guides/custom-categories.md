# How-to: Custom Categories

BlinkBudget allows you to tailor your expense tracking by creating, editing, and organizing your own categories. This guide covers how to manage your category system.

## 1. Accessing the Category Manager

All category management happens in a dedicated interface:

1.  Open **Settings** (⚙️ icon in the bottom navigation).
2.  Locate the **🏷️ Category Management** section.
3.  Click the **"Manage Categories"** button.

## 2. Custom vs. System Categories

- **System Categories**: Pre-defined categories (like "Grocery" or "Salary") that ensure the app works out of the box. These cannot be edited or deleted.
- **Custom Categories**: Categories created by you. You have full control over their name, color, and description.

## 3. Creating a New Category

1.  In the Category Manager, click the **"Add"** button in the top right.
2.  Fill in the category details:
    - **Name**: A clear, concise title (e.g., "Hobby", "Pet Supplies").
    - **Type**: Choose between **Expense** or **Income**.
    - **Color**: Select a color to represent this category in charts and lists.
    - **Description**: (Optional) Add a note about what this category covers.
3.  Click **"Create"**.

## 4. Managing Existing Categories

### Switching Types

Use the **Expense / Income** toggle at the top of the manager to switch between your expense and income category lists.

### Searching

If you have many categories, use the search bar at the top to find specific ones by name.

### Editing

1.  Find the category card you wish to change.
2.  Click the **"Edit"** button.
3.  Modify any fields and click **"Update"**.

### Deleting

1.  Find the category card.
2.  Click **"Delete"**.
3.  Confirm the action in the dialog.
    - _Note: Deleting a category will mark it as "Other" or "Uncategorized" in your existing transactions._

## 5. Visual Hierarchy

Categories are visually distinguished by their colors in:

- The **Dashboard** transaction list.
- **Reports** pie charts and trend lines.
- **Transaction Entry** chips (the icons will match your selected color).
