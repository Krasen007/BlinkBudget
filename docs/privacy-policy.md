## 3. Data Storage and Architecture

### 3.1 Hybrid Storage Model

BlinkBudget uses a hybrid local-cloud architecture designed for privacy and performance:

**Local Storage (Primary):**

- All financial data is primarily stored in your browser's localStorage
- Data remains on your device and is accessible offline
- No data is transmitted to cloud servers without explicit user action

**Security Limitations of localStorage:**

- localStorage is not encrypted and is stored in plain text on your device
- Data is accessible to any script running on the same origin (vulnerable to XSS attacks)
- Anyone with physical access to your device can potentially access stored data

**Cloud Storage (Optional):**

- Cloud synchronization is only available when you create an account and log in
- Cloud storage via Firebase Firestore provides backup and cross-device sync
- You can use the app entirely offline without creating an account

### 3.2 Data Encryption and Security

- **Local Data:** Stored in browser localStorage (accessible only to the app)
- **Cloud Data:** Encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS and at rest in Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication:** Managed by Firebase Authentication with industry-standard security
- **Access Control:** User data is isolated by user ID with strict access controls

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 4.1 No Third-Party Sharing

- We do not sell, rent, or share your personal financial data with third parties
- Your transaction data is never used for advertising or marketing purposes
- We do not share your information with data brokers or analytics companies

### 4.2 Service Providers

- **Firebase (Google):** Used for authentication and optional cloud storage
- **Netlify:** Used for application hosting
- These providers have strict data protection agreements and access only to the minimum data necessary
- GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) are in place with both Firebase and Netlify under GDPR Article 28, governing all data processing and limiting access to necessary data only. Users may request a copy of these DPAs by contacting privacy@blinkbudget.app

### 4.3 Legal Requirements

- We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights
- Any such disclosure will be limited to what is legally required
- We will notify users when legally permitted to do so

## 5. Data Retention

### 5.1 Local Data

- Data stored in localStorage remains until you clear it
- You can delete all data through the app's data management features

### 5.2 Cloud Data

- Cloud data is retained as long as your account is active
- You can delete your account and all associated data at any time through the Settings > Account Deletion section
- Active data is deleted immediately, while backup copies are purged within 30 days as part of our backup rotation cycle
- **Account Deletion Process:** When you delete your account, the following occurs:
  - A final data export is automatically generated and downloaded for your records
  - All transactions, accounts, goals, investments, budgets, and settings are permanently deleted
  - Authentication data is removed and you are logged out immediately
  - A deletion record is created for compliance purposes
  - The entire process is audited and logged for security and compliance
