# 📊 UX Audit Report: BlinkBudget (Feb 2026)

## 1. Executive Summary

BlinkBudget successfully delivers on its "3-click" promise through a high-efficiency auto-submit model. The visual aesthetic is premium and modern, utilizing a sophisticated dark mode palette. However, there are opportunities to improve accessibility (ARIA), localization consistency, and "safety nets" for high-speed interactions.

## 2. Core Value Chain: The "3-Click" Promise

**Status: ✅ Fulfilled**

- **Flow Analysis:**
  1. **Dashboard Click:** `+ Add Transaction`.
  2. **Auto-Action:** System focuses the numeric field; keyboard appears automatically.
  3. **Final Click:** Tapping a **Category Chip** (e.g., "Храна") triggers auto-submit.
- **Strength:** This is industry-leading speed for manual entry.
- **Risk:** High-speed entry without a confirmation state leads to "false-starts" if the wrong category is tapped.

## 3. Visual Design & Aesthetics

**Status: ⭐ Premium**

- **Color Palette:** Professional dark scheme using HSL tokens (`hsl(240, 10%, 4%)`). Very easy on the eyes for night-time tracking.
- **Typography:** Excellent pairing of **Outfit** (Headings) for brand personality and **Inter** (Body) for high legibility.
- **Motion:** Subtle touch-active feedback (`scale(0.96)`) on buttons and chips adds a premium tactile feel.

## 4. Friction Points & UX Debt

### 🛑 Critical Friction

- **Confirmation Blindness:** Lack of an "Undo" snackbar or confirmation toast after auto-submit.
- **The "Back" Maze:** Inconsistent labeling. Some views use "← Back", others "Cancel", others "Done".
- **Localization Fragmentation:** Bulgarian categories paired with English UI controls (e.g., "Save", "Add Transaction").

### ♿ Accessibility (a11y)

- **Missing ARIA:** Category chips and type toggles lack proper roles (`role="radiogroup"`) and states (`aria-checked`), making the app difficult for screen reader users.
- **Color Contrast:** Most categories pass WCAG AA, but dark blue on dark surfaces may need adjustment.

### 📱 Mobile Parity

- **Safe Area Support:** The app correctly handles notches and home indicators via CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)`.
- **Keyboard Overlap:** Well-managed via `keyboard-visible` CSS classes and viewport height adjustments.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations

1. **Standardize Navigation:** Unify all "Back" buttons under a single `BackButton` component with consistent labeling.
2. **Safety Net:** Implement a 3-second "Undo" snackbar after auto-submitting a transaction.
3. **Accessibility Audit:** Add ARIA labels to all interactive custom elements.
4. **Emergency Export:** (In Progress) Provide a fail-safe data recovery button for sync failures.
